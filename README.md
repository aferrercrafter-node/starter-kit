### Javascript Editos

__What to look for__

* _Strong ES2015+ support_
    - Autocompletion
    - Parse ES6 imports
    - Report unused imports
    - Automated refactoring
* _Framework Intelligence_
* _Built-in Terminal_

Options: Atom, WebStorm, Brackets, VSCode

Note: Even if Visual Studio / Eclipse or Net Beans, are more stronger/used IDEs, they are not focused on bring the last features of javascript. 
ItÂ´s fine to use this IDE for backend code, and VSCode for frontend javascrpit code. _You are using the best tool, for each job!_

__Automated Consistency via Editorconfig__

_EditorConfig_ helps developers define and mantain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. Consists in a file format for defining conding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enables editor to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.

.editorconfig

 ``` bash
    # editorconfig
    root = true

    [*]
    indent_styles = space
    indent_size = 2
    end_of_line = lf
    charset = utf-8
    trim_trailing_whitespace = true
    insert_final_newline = true

    [*.md] 
    trim_trailing_whitespace = false
 ```

 Some editors need a plugin. You can go to editorconfig.org and check there for the plugin, for each IDE,
